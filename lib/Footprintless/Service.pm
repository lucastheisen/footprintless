=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Standard way of getting a service
    use Footprintless;
    my $service = Footprintless->new()->service();

    $service->stop();

    $service->start();

    $service->status();

    $service->kill();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Manages services.  Allows you to start, stop, check the status of, and
kill services.  Additional actions can be configured as well.

=head1 ENTITIES

A simple service (the most common case) can be defined:

    service => {
        command => '/opt/foo/bar.sh',
        pid_file => '/var/run/bar/bar.pid'
    }

A more complex service might be defined:

    service => {
        actions => {
            debug => {command_args => "jpda start"},
            kill => {command_args => "stop -kill"},
            status => {use_pid => 1, command_name => 'tomcat'},
        },
        command => '/opt/tomcat/catalina.sh',
        hostname => 'tomcat.pastdev.com',
        pid_command => 'ps -aef|grep "/opt/tomcat/"|grep -v grep|awk \'{print \$2}\'',
        sudo_username => 'tomcat',
    }

In this case, an additional action, debug, was added, kill was redefined
as a special case of stop, and status was redefined to use the pid 
(ex: kill -0 $pid).  Also, the pid is found via command rather than a file.

=constructor new($entity, $coordinate, %options)

Constructs a new service configured by C<$entities> at C<$coordinate>.  
The supported options are:

=over 4

=item command_options_factory

The command options factory to use.  Defaults to an instance of
L<Footprintless::CommandOptionsFactory> using the C<localhost> instance
of this object.

=item command_runner

The command runner to use.  Defaults to an instance of 
L<Footprintless::CommandRunner::IPCRun>.

=item localhost

The localhost alias resolver to use.  Defaults to an instance of
L<Footprintless::Localhost> configured with C<load_all()>.

=back

=method execute($action)

Executes C<$action> on the service.

=method kill()

Kills the service.

=method start()

Starts the service.

=method status()

Prints out the status of the service.

=method stop()

Stops the service.
